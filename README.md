Before you begin, ensure that your development environment has the following:

   - PHP: Version 8.2.12 or highe
   - XAMPP: XAMPP with PHP 8.2.12 is recommended

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuring XAMPP for Email Sending (Windows)
### 1. Modify the xampp/php/php.ini file:

    - Open the xampp/php/php.ini file with a text editor.
    - Ensure the following lines are configured correctly


```
SMTP=smtp.example.com
smtp_port=587
sendmail_from=your_email@example.com
sendmail_path="\"C:\xampp\sendmail\sendmail.exe\" -t"
```
        
### 2. Modify the xampp/sendmail/sendmail.ini file:
    
    - Open the xampp/sendmail/sendmail.ini file with a text editor.
    
    - Ensure the following lines are configured correctly:
```
